		<h1>Library Computer Instructions</h1>
		<br/>
			
		</p>
		<p>These instructions are to use the Holmstad library computer as both a Kiosk for patrons and also for librarian use.</p>
		<p>The Librarian logon has unlimited access to the PC.</p>
		<p>When powered on you will be presented with the option to logon as Kiosk or as Library.</p>

		<h2>Kiosk</h2>
		<p>The Kiosk logon gives limited access to the PC and is only useful for accessing the computer as a kiosk.</p>

		<p>Kiosk has no password so if prompted just hit "Return" or "Enter"</p>

		<p>In Kiosk mode the user will be presented with the Library Thing website,
		allowing searching for books by Title, Author, Dewey and Tag etc..</p>

		<h2>Library Logon</h2>
		<p>To quit Kiosk mode, select "?" then "Admin" then "Exit". A password prompt will be presented before exiting. The password is the same as the library logon password.</p>
		<p>The Library logon uses the given password to logon.</p>
