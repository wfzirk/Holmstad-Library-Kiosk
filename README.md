**Library Computer Instructions**

These instructions are to use the Holmstad library computer as both a Kiosk for patrons and also for librarian use.

The Librarian logon has unlimited access to the PC.
The Kiosk logon gives limited access to the PC and is only useful for accessing the computer as a kiosk.
When powered on you will be presented with the option to logon as Kiosk or as Library.
Kiosk has no password so if prompted just hit return

The Library logon uses the given password to logon.
In Kiosk mode the user will be presented with the Library Thing website, allowing searching for books by Title, Author, Dewey and Tag etc..

To quit Kiosk mode, typing ctrl-w will prompt for a password before exiting. The password is the same as the library logon password.
